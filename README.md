## ðŸ™Œ Project Personal Milestones

- Immersed myself in understanding backend web development with Python.
- Created my first web server using Flask.
- Learned how to work with Flask URL paths, render HTML files, and serve static files.
- Accelerated the project's development by integrating a pre-existing website template.
- Utilized Jinja templating to create dynamic HTML pages.

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration for creating this project

Iâ€™m currently enrolled in 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp (Udemy) and this is the courseâ€™s #57th project. Iâ€™m proud to acknowledge this project as my very first working web development. 

## ðŸ‘€ About the project

I felt comfortable crafting the webpage, as I had prior experience with HTML and CSS. However, building the backend using Python was entirely new to me. I enjoyed creating dynamic HTML behavior and am eager to continue developing for the web. I was pleased with the final result. This project felt right and brought together all my learning in one place.
